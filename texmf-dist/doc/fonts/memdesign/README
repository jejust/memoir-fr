    The distribution consists of the following files:

memetc.bib            Bibliography database

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

    The memoir class and files memsty.sty, titlepages.sty, memman.ist,
and anvil2.mps are required to process memdesign.tex; these are part
of the memoir distribution (the documentation).

    memdesign.pdf includes many examples of different typefaces. Some
of these are from the FontSite500 CD. If you do not have these and want 
to process memdesign.tex yourself, then use the class draft option:
\documentclass[draft,...]{memoir}
Processing also requires the free Web-O-Mints font. 

    To process memdesign.tex (if you really want to do this and not just use 
memdesign.pdf as supplied)
o Run (pdf)latex twice on memdesign.tex
o Run bibtex memdesign 
o For an index run: makeindex -s memman.ist memdesign
o Run (pdf)latex once more on memdesign.tex
o Print the manual
