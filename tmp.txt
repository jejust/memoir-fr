Letterspacing is the insertion of spaces between the letters of a word. Frederic Goudy (1865\u20131947), a very respected American typographer and type designer, is said to have been fond of saying, \u2018A man who would letterspace lower case letters would steal sheep!\u2019 Writing in 1999 Robert Bringhurst (Bringhurst 1999, p. 31) felt that to bring this dictum to modern times it was simply necessary to add that \u2018A woman who would letterspace lowercase would also steal sheep.\u2019

Letterspacing is usually restricted to titles composed of uppercase letters with the intent of making the spaces between the letters visually equal. Figure 5.3 shows the word \u2018HISTORY\u2019 with various amounts of interletter spacings. With no extra spacing it looks cramped compared with the spaced versions. Versions with uniform spacing of thin (0.167 em) and hair (0.1 em) spaces are much improved. However, the spacing of the letters \u2018H\u2019, \u2018I\u2019 and \u2018S\u2019 leave something to be desired, and is especially noticeable in the version with thin spaces. Lastly a version with varied interletter spacing is shown which is optically balanced; the spaces in this case are 0.09 em, 0.12 em, 0.1 em, 0.1 em, 0.07 em and 0.1 em. The difference between this and the uniformly hair-spaced version is subtle. Different letter combinations and different fonts will require different amounts of spaces.

Figure 5.4 shows similar results for the same word set in small caps instead of regular caps. In general you might find that if  you do letterspace then uniform spacing is  adequate for small caps.

There can be occasions, as with emphasis with fraktur fonts, when letterspacing lowercase will not get you hung for sheep stealing. These, typically, are when dealing with some sans fonts such as a bold condensed Univers. But be very careful. Italics should never be letterspaced as they come from the handwriting tradition of \u2018joined up letters\u2019, as my kindergarten teacher used to call them.
