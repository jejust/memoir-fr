Copying
*******

   Unfortunately, the licensing situation is somewhat complicated.
There are essentially four distinct components with four different
licenses:

  1. The font outlines on the CD are covered by a license from Title
     Wave Studios.  You must purchase the CD and may not redistribute
     the fonts.  Please see the file `license.txt' on the CD.

  2. The scripts and control files in the `fs500src' distribution are
     _free software;_ you may redistribute and/or modify them under the
     terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL).  This license does
     _not_ permit incorporating the scripts into proprietary programs.
     Please see the file `COPYING' in the source distribution.

  3. The TeX font metrics, virtual font files, LaTeX font definitions
     and style files from the `fs500tex' distribution are contributed
     to the public domain.  Although these files are the results of
     executing GPL code, they are not _derivative works_ thereof and
     are thus _not covered_ by the GPL.  If anything, they are
     derivative works of the font metrics on the CD.  You may use and
     distribute them without restriction.  (If you somehow include them
     in a commercial system, I would appreciate an acknowledgment.)

  4. Finally, the manual is copyrighted, but permission is granted to
     make and distribute verbatim copies.
