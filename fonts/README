Announcing
**********

   The FontSite 500 CD is a collection of 512 professional quality
Type 1 (and TrueType) fonts licensed from the SoftMaker/ATF library and
available for a very reasonable price from `http://www.fontsite.com/'.
The CD contains many essential faces and extended families with expert
sets, true small caps, old-style figures, a range of weights and
widths, and so on.

   I developed a series of scripts and control files that drive
`fontinst' to generate all the TeX support files and font maps.  Now, a
huge variety of essential typefaces are available to TeX/LaTeX users
who purchase the FontSite CD and download these files.

   * The package supports the LaTeX New Font Selection Scheme (NFSS)
     using the TeX text (OT1), text companion (TS1), Cork (T1), and/or
     tex'n'ansi (LY1) encodings.

   * A custom Postscript encoding vector (upward compatible from
     TeX base 1) exposes glyphs (such as infinity, pi, and Omega) that
     are available in most FontSite fonts, but not encoded by default.

   * If an expert variant is available, its fraction glyphs and
     ligatures such as `ffi' and even `ft' are merged into the final
     encoding and selected transparently.

   * If old-style figures are available (usually with the small caps
     shape) then they are merged into a family variant that uses them
     by default, with no additional markup.

   * The file names (vaguely) follow the `fontname' standard.  They do
     not exceed 8+3 characters, so they should work with any operating
     system.

   * The package also includes maps for using the fonts with Ghostscript
     and X windows.

The web site is <http://contrapunctus.net/fs500tex/>; there you will
find the following files:

`fs500tex.pdf' (about 4.2M)
     The manual, with samples of all the fonts and extensive indexing.
     Along with the material at `http://www.fontsite.com/', this
     document may help you decide whether to purchase the FontSite CD.

`fs500tex-1.1_cd??.tgz' (about 4.8M)
     The primary distribution.  It contains the TeX and LaTeX support
     files and instructions for installing them.  A version of the
     manual _without_ font samples (in GNU info format) is included.
     You must get the package corresponding to the copyright date on
     your CD (see the web site for details).

`fs500src-1.1.tgz' (about 120k)
     The script package, distributed under the terms of the GNU GPL.
     It assumes you have a Unix system with particular tools available,
     and its documentation is somewhat sketchy.  Grab this if you want
     to read or modify the scripts; do not assume that you will just
     save time compared to downloading the binaries!

   Bug reports, patches, suggestions, questions, and praise are all
welcome; please send email to <league@contrapunctus.net>.

User-visible changes
====================

version 1.1
-----------

   * Released 29 May 2003

   * Added all the decorative fonts that had been omitted until now.

   * Updated documentation with suggestions from many users (thanks!)

   * Included a brief document with font samples, suggested and
     initially designed by Karl Berry.

   * Changes to continue to accommodate older editions of the CD.

version 1.0
-----------

   * Released 28 March 2003

   * Initial support for the 2003 CD (5th edition).  There were many
     font name and encoding changes.

version 0.9
-----------

   * Released 23 November 2002

   * The LaTeX font definition files now use standard NFSS series codes.
     Thanks to Walter Schmidt and Ralf Stubner for indicating the way.

   * Reasonable font substitutions are defined automatically.  If you
     come across a family that does behave as expected under the
     following series/shape combinations, please report it as a bug:
     `m/n', `m/it', `bx/n', `bx/it'.  Substitutions between slanted and
     italic are standard also, but they produce a warning message.

   * Symbol fonts are now available: Arrows, Chap Borders,
     CombiNumerals, Deanna Borders, Deanna Flowers, Linedraw Fixed,
     Sean Symbols.  Complete glyph charts for these are available in
     the manual.

   * CombiNumerals are circled sans-serif numerals, either open (black
     on white) or solid (white on black).  The package `combinum.sty'
     can automatically render TeX or LaTeX counters (with values up to
     99) as CombiNumerals.  It is now trivial to use CombiNumerals as
     page numbers or in enumerations.

   * OCR-A and OCR-B have been merged into one family with two distinct
     shapes.

   * I worked around broken spacing in Bank Gothic ligatures.  I fixed a
     bug in the ATF Clearface expert set, reported by Uwe Steinmann.


version 0.8
-----------

   * Released 1 October 2002

   * Updated to work with the 2001 FontSite CD.  I originally had the
     2000 version, so people who ordered new CDs had problems.  Thanks
     to Stephen Peters.

   * Font definition files are now available for expert sets, so they
     can be used with the `pifont' package.

   * Added more decorative and script faces.

   * Renamed the Syntax package to `syntaxf.sty', to avoid name
     collision.

version 0.7
-----------

   * First public release, 29 August 2002.

   * All text and sans serif families are supported, but some decorative
     and all the symbol fonts are missing.

   * A LaTeX package interface exists, but is quite primitive.
