 we met above. The fundamental unit is the point; \tref{tab:units} lists

 a good overview see~\autocite{CHAPPELL99} and Fred Smeijers~\autocite{SMEIJERS96}

-for a font, for each character, a punchcutter makes a punch starting 
-with a square steel bar about 2\slashfrac{1}{4}inches (6cm) long with an 
-end face large enough to encompass the character. Using files and gravers,
-and perhaps some specialized tools like a counterpunch, 
-he carves out the character in relief on one end of the bar. The character
-is oriented so that is backwards with respect to its appearance when printed.
-To check the shape, the end of the punch is put into the flame of an alcohol
-lamp which coats it with lampblack, and it is then pressed against a chalky 
-paper to leave a black image of the character. Once the shape is correct 
-the punch is hardened and annealed.

    The next stage is to create the matrix for the character. The punch is
 hammered into a softer material, usually copper, or sometimes brass which
 is harder but lasts longer. At this point the character is in the same
 orientation as printed but is a negative impression in the matrix.

 first wrote the inscription on the stone using a broad, flat brush. This

 depending on the angle of the stroke with respect to the movement and

 serifs.
 
     Between the Roman times and Gutenberg there were many changes and
 experiments in European letterforms. The scribes used different scripts
 for titles, subheads, continuous text, illuminated initial letters, and so
 on. In time, two families of letterforms evolved, 
 called \emph{majuscules}\index{majuscule} and \emph{minuscules}\index{minuscule}.

 throughout his wide flung empire the Anglo Saxon Benedictine monk 
 Alcuin\index{Alcuin}, at the behest of Charlemagne, established a common
 script to be used; this is now called Carolingian 
 minuscule\index{minuscule!Carolingian}.
 A further division also appeared, between black letter (what is
 commonly referred to as Gothic or Old English) type and the roman type.
 
     These types were all upright. Italic\index{italic} letterforms were
