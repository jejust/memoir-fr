 the lines of normal text is \emph{leading}\index{leading}, which is also
 usually expressed in points and is usually larger than the font size.
 A convention for describing the font and leading is to give the font size

 \section{Units of measurement}
 
     Typographers and printers use a mixed system of units, some of which
 we met above. The fundamental unit is the point; \tref{tab:units} lists 
 the most common units employed.

     During the sixteenth century the French types were popular throughout
 Europe but then the pendulum swung towards types from the Low Countries.

     The first European letter forms that have survived are Greek inscriptions
 carved into stone. These were freehand carvings with thin strokes. In time,
 the lettering became thicker and serifs started to appear. The Romans
-picked up on this later style of letter form. In carving inscriptions, they
+picked up on this later style of letterform. In carving inscriptions, they
 first wrote the inscription on the stone using a broad, flat brush. This
 naturally led to serifs and differing thicknesses of the letter strokes,
 depending on the angle of the stroke with respect to the movement and
 orientation of the brush. Similarly the written letterforms included
 serifs.
 
     Between the Roman times and Gutenberg there were many changes and
 experiments in European letterforms. The scribes used different scripts
 for titles, subheads, continuous text, illuminated initial letters, and so
 on. In time, two families of letterforms evolved, 
 called \emph{majuscules}\index{majuscule} and \emph{minuscules}\index{minuscule}. 
 The former were larger and more formal, while the latter
-were smaller and less formal. We now call these two divisions upper case and
-lower case. The upper case derives from Roman times, while the lower case
+were smaller and less formal. We now call these two divisions uppercase and
+lowercase. The uppercase derives from Roman times, while the lowercase
 acquired its fundamental form during the reign of the Holy Roman Emperor
 Charlemagne\index{Charlemagne} a thousand years later. In order to 
 promote communication
 throughout his wide flung empire the Anglo Saxon Benedictine monk 
 Alcuin\index{Alcuin}, at the behest of Charlemagne, established a common
 script to be used; this is now called Carolingian 
 minuscule\index{minuscule!Carolingian}.
 A further division also appeared, between black letter (what is
 commonly referred to as Gothic or Old English) type and the roman type.
 
     These types were all upright. Italic\index{italic} letterforms were 
 cut in Italy
 in the early sixteenth century, as a more cursive style. Initially these were
-lower case only, used in conjunction with upper case roman. By the end of
